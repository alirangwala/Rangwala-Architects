        Since 1996 Mr. Rangwala has worked extensively on all my projects,
        including retail centers and all movie theatres. With each project, Mr.
        Rangwala has committed himself in overseeing every detail of every
        aspect of the project’s development, uncompromising with regards to
        quality, but ever aware of the necessity of staying within a budget and
        completing the project on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I have, without a moment’s hesitation, recommended Mr.
        Rangwala to family and friends for both residential and commercial
        projects. All have been extremely pleased with his work and have enjoyed
        the experience of a professional relationship with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Rangwala has over 2 decades of experience in all aspects of design
        and build. Rarely will you find a more prolific architect. At this point
        in his career I can state with first-hand knowledge, he is creating
        extraordinary work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr. Rangwala is an extremely talented architect, but even more
        importantly, a principled individual. My life is far richer for having
        had the pleasure to work and get to know this man over the past several
        years.

        This letter is a far-too-delayed documentation of the many times I
        thanked you for the outstanding architectural services you provided for
        the City of Edwardsville.

        You know, as well as anyone, the Wildey Theatre had a very questionable
        future. The community seemed somewhat divided on what action was
        appropriate for a building constructed in 1909 and abandoned for the
        past 25 years. It seemed impossible that funding could be found for the
        renovation of a building that faced such significant challenges. Someone
        needed a vision that could be placed on paper so others could see the
        possibilities and, in turn, support those possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, through the special Wildey Committee appointed by the mayor
        and confirmed by the city council, vision became reality. This
        beautifully appointed and functional building that so magnificently
        connects the past with what I know will be many years of future use is
        now reality because you gave life to it through your amazing
        architectural talent. You are the one who proved that vision can become
        reality with a sense of purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of architectural talent that worked within our financial
        limitations, architectural talent that understood our wants and needs,
        architectural talent that exercised patience in a necessarily political
        environment, vision not only became reality…vision became the
        fulfillment of a purpose. This, of course, meant a purpose that included
        salvation of a historic building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today and in all our foreseeable “tomorrows,” the historic Wildey
        Theatre will meet its mission of providing a multi-purpose, cultural,
        educational and entertainment venue for generations to celebrate.

        I am pleased to give a high recommendation to Rangwala Architects, and
        its Principal, SalimRangwala, for consideration by you for the design
        and implementation of both concept and working drawings for retail
        property development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have known and worked with Salim for a number of years. He is
        creative, responsive, bright, good at solving problems, and produces a
        fine, quality product that is attractive and usually has a timelessness
        in its design.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have always had an honest and fair relationship, and I highly respect
        him for his accomplishments and appreciate the assistance he has given
        us.
